          I created this website as a side project to learn more about Vue.js
          and web development. I also wanted to reverse engineer BeReal's API
          and create a web app that would allow users to view their BeReal data.
          This happens to allow users to also view their friends BeReals without
          posting their own BeReals and screenshot BeReals. This website was
          designed from ground up to work on mobile devices. All the styling is
          done with <span class="font-bold">Tailwind CSS</span>
        </p>
        <p class="text-base">
          I don't have plans on monetizing this site hence there will
          <span class="font-bold">never</span> be ads on this website at least
          for the forseeable future. However I will happily accept donations.
